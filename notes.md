# Files & Directories
* Files are digital containers that store data
    * Can hold audio, text, images, etc.
    * They have a name and are stored in a directory
    * File extensions decide what type of data is stored, creating file formats (ex: jpeg/png for image, mp3 for audio, exe for application)
* Directories are folders that allow you to organize file in a hierarchical way
    * Creates cleanliness and an organized file explorer
    * Allows you to find specific files that are stored on the hard drive
    * Permissions can be created for some files, creating a potential security benefit
    * The $HOME directory is used in Unix operating systems (macOS, Linux), and this is where personal information is stored.
# Use of Command Line
* Allows programmers to understand the system at a higher level, which helps to develop skills in software development and system administration
* here are many command lines
    * Command prompt is the basic Windows command interpreter
        * You can interact with the OS with commands
        * Includes navigating files, running programs.

        * All changes are saved in repository
* Github is a online type Git that creates collaboration on development projects
    * Has tool to host repositories
    * Has other features such as issue tracking, code review, and project management → popularity for open source projects
    * Developers share/collaborate on code
* Git and Github helps in development because they can create repositories, you can commit files to this repository, and if you need to edit these file, you can make a branch that will eventually make your new local file the same as the main repository file.
* There are also many commands that you can use, including a command to initialize/create a repository, commit changes, logs, and history, fetching files, and creating branches
